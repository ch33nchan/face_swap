CRITICAL - NEVER CHANGE (from Image 1):
- Character's EXACT body pose, arm positions, leg positions, head tilt, body angle
- Character's EXACT position in the frame (where they are standing/sitting)
- Background, scene, environment - must be PIXEL PERFECT same
- Camera angle, framing, composition, crop
- Lighting and shadows
- Composition

SWAP ONLY these visual features FROM Image 2:
- Face shape and facial features
- Hair color, style, and length
- Clothing appearance (colors, patterns, open/closed state of clothes eg: jacket open vs closed, style)
- Visible accessories (jewelry, glasses, hats, etc.)

- Facial expression fix: Set both eyes to look directly upward, open the mouth to expose upper teeth with a tense, concerned expression, and tilt the head slightly to match an upward-looking orientation.
Think of it like a costume change on the EXACT same character pose. The silhouette and position should be IDENTICAL to Image 1.

Output: Image 1 with ONLY the character's visual appearance changed to match Image 2. Pose and composition UNCHANGED.

- Facial expression fix: Adjust the head to tilt slightly backward, widen the mouth fully to show teeth and tongue in an aggressive shouting state, and ensure the eyes are wide open looking fully to the left in an angry expression.

DO NOT change pose, position, or composition.

CRITICAL - NEVER CHANGE (from Image 1):
- Character's EXACT body pose, arm positions, leg positions, head tilt, body angle
- Character's EXACT position in the frame (where they are standing/sitting)
- Background, scene, environment - must be PIXEL PERFECT same
- Camera angle, framing, composition, crop
- Lighting and shadows
- Composition

SWAP ONLY these visual features FROM Image 2:
- Face shape and facial features
- Hair color, style, and length
- Clothing appearance (colors, patterns, open/closed state of clothes eg: jacket open vs closed, style)
- Visible accessories (jewelry, glasses, hats, etc.)

- Facial expression fix: Tilt the woman's head downwards slightly, and adjust her hair to be long, loose wavy blonde, replacing the straight hair with wavy texture and longer, flowing length.
Think of it like a costume change on the EXACT same character pose. The silhouette and position should be IDENTICAL to Image 1.

Output: Image 1 with ONLY the character's visual appearance changed to match Image 2. Pose and composition UNCHANGED.
